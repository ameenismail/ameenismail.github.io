            <p>During my time at Cornell I have been a TA for PHYS 1101 and PHYS 2217, as well as a grader for PHYS 7652 and PHYS 6554. Here you can find infomation about these classes and some student feedback.</p>
            <section id="phys-6554">
                <h2>p6554: general relativity II | grader, spring 2021</h2>
                <p>Covered Kerr and Reissner-Nordstrom black holes, the Penrose process, superradiance, FRW cosmology, inflation, and cosmological perturbation theory.</p>
                <p>I graded homework assignments and held weekly office hours.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="phys-6554">
                <h2>p7652: relativistic QFT II | grader, spring 2020</h2>
                <p>Covered path integrals in QFT, symmetry breaking, Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theory, the renormalization group, and anomalies.</p>
                <p>I graded homework assignments, held weekly office hours, and wrote half of the final exam.</p>
                <p>After the semester ended, the students sent me some great gifts, as you can see on the right: a shirt and two books!</p>

            <section id="phys-2217">
                <h2>p2217: electricity and magnetism | TA, spring 2020</h2>
                <p>Introduction to electromagnetism for physics majors. I taught two discussion sections and a lab section.</p>
                <p>Some notes from discussion sections:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="files/dis201_0406.pdf">Ampere's law, current-carrying wires and sheets</a> (6 April)</li><br>
                    <li><a href="files/dis201_0413.pdf">Induced electric field from sinusoidal current</a> (13 April)</li><br>
                    <li><a href="files/dis201_0427.pdf">Relativistic formulation of Maxwell's equations</a> (27 April)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Comments from students (emphasis mine):</p>
                <blockquote><i>
                    <p>Arguably as helpful, if not more helpful, than the lectures themselves</p>
                    <p>...always found a way to explain complicated topics in very simple terms...</p>
                    <p>...<b>sparked my interest in physics</b> by posing interesting high-level questions.</p>
                    <p>Really fun guy... able to teach in an understandable and lighthearted manner that I really liked.</p>
                    <p>...would always teach us some additional, occasionally advanced extensions to our EM curriculum that <b>really helped deepen our understanding of physics</b>.</p>
                </i></blockquote>

            <section id="phys-1101">
                <h2>p1101: general physics I | TA, fall 2019</h2>
                <p>Algebra-based introduction to physics for non-majors. It's also an autotutorial (self-paced) class.</p>
                <p>It was very rewarding to teach students with no background in physics&mdash;even more so because of the many opportunities for one-on-one tutoring, as opposed to teaching groups.</p>
