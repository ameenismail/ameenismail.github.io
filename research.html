                <h2>hierarchy problem</h2>
                <p> I'm interested in building new approaches to the Higgs hierarchy or naturalness problem. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14396">Crunching Dilaton, Hidden Naturalness (2007.14396)</a>, we introduced a new way to solve the hierarchy problem. The idea is to have a multiverse where some scanning sector sets the value of the Higgs mass in each causal patch. We then introduce some new dynamics so that all patches except those where the Higgs mass lies in a finite range undergo a cosmological crunch in the early universe. The only patches that survive through inflation to the present day are those where the Higgs mass is small, generating an apparent fine-tuning.</p>
                <p>The main experimental signature of our model is a light new scalar, with a mass around a GeV or so, that mixes weakly with the Higgs. Most of the parameter space can be probed by experiments within the next decade. I wrote a little piece in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05090">Forward Physics Facility (FPF) white paper (2203.05090)</a> about the opportunity to look for this new scalar at the FPF. I am currently working on a couple of follow-up projects involving variations on our model and possible UV completions.</p>

                <h2>dilatons and CFTs</h2>
                <p>Theories with conformal sectors in which scale invariance is spontaneously broken show up in a lot of different model-building contexts. Actually, I've already mentioned such a theory: a spontaneously broken conformal sector is a key part of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14396">Crunching Dilaton, Hidden Naturalness (2007.14396)</a> paper discussed above. I'm also currently working on a project related to continuum dark matter (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07035">2105.07035</a> for some background on this), which also features a spontaneously broken CFT.</p>
                <p>These models generally feature a new particle called a dilaton, which is the Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken scale invariance. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15324">a-Anomalous Interactions of the Holographic Dilaton (2205.15324)</a>, we explored the low-energy effective action for the dilaton. There's a particular term in the action whose coefficient is fixed by an anomaly in the CFT. This can have important consequences for phenomenology and cosmology!</p>

                <h2>extended Higgs sectors</h2>
                <p>Starting the summer after undergrad and continuing into grad school, I worked on the Georgi-Machacek model. In this model, the Standard Model Higgs sector is extended by two SU(2) triplets, in such a way that naturally preserves the rho-parameter (the W to Z boson mass ratio; equivalently, the electroweak T parameter) at tree level. Another interesting feature in this model is the existence of doubly charged Higgs bosons. More generally, it serves as a nice prototype for extensions of the Higgs sector containing SU(2) representation larger than doublets.</p>
                <p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02272">Updated constraints on the Georgi-Machacek model from LHC Run 2 (2003.02272)</a>, we did an extensive analysis of the experimental constraints on this model from direct searches for new Higgs bosons, as well as from measurements of the observed 125 GeV Higgs. Some of the code I wrote was later integrated into the next release of the Georgi-Machacek model calculator, <a href="https://people.physics.carleton.ca/~logan/gmcalc/">GMCALC</a>. We also introduced a new benchmark for studying a particular region of the model's parameter space, the so-called "low-m<sub>5</sub>" region, in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05536">Benchmark for LHC searches for low-mass custodial fiveplet scalars in the Georgi-Machacek model (2003.05536)</a>.
