                <h2>hierarchy problem</h2>
                <p> I'm interested in building new approaches to the Higgs hierarchy or naturalness problem. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14396">Crunching Dilaton, Hidden Naturalness (2007.14396)</a>, we introduced a new way to solve the hierarchy problem. The idea is to have a multiverse where some scanning sector sets the value of the Higgs mass in each causal patch. We then introduce some new dynamics so that all patches except those where the Higgs mass lies in a finite range undergo a cosmological crunch in the early universe. The only patches that survive through inflation to the present day are those where the Higgs mass is small, generating an apparent fine-tuning.</p>
                <p>The main experimental signature of our model is a light new scalar, with a mass around a GeV or so, that mixes weakly with the Higgs. Most of the parameter space can be probed by experiments within the next decade. I wrote a little piece in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05090">Forward Physics Facility (FPF) white paper (2203.05090)</a> about the opportunity to look for this new scalar at the FPF.</p>
                <p>In a follow-up paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02456">Higgs Squared (2210.02456)</a>, we thought more carefully about the kinds of operators that can trigger the type of phase transition which is needed for cosmological selection of a small Higgs mass. The operator has to be sensitive to the Higgs vacuum expectation value. We constructed the first example in the literature of a trigger operator that is completely neutral under the Standard Model gauge group. We then applied this to solve the hierarchy problem in a manner similar to the crunching dilaton, but which leads to radically different phenomenology.</p>

                <h2>dark matter</h2>
                <p>I am also interested in building models of dark matter. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16326">The Continuum Dark Matter Zoo (2210.16326)</a> we described a class of dark matter models where the dark matter is a continuum state, rather than an ordinary particle. (This is somewhat analogous to the distinction between continuum and bound states in ordinary nonrelativistic quantum mechanics.) This paper built on some previous work on continuum dark matter, see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07035">2105.07035</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14023">2105.14023</a>. The basic idea is that continuum states exhibit very unique kinematics, which leads to an enormous suppression of direct detection bounds. Thus, simple WIMP-like models of dark matter that would be ruled out for ordinary particles are totally allowed if the dark matter is a continuum state.</p>

                <h2>dilatons and CFTs</h2>
                <p>Theories with conformal sectors in which scale invariance is spontaneously broken show up in a lot of different model-building contexts. Actually, I've already mentioned such a theory: a spontaneously broken conformal sector is a key part of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14396">Crunching Dilaton, Hidden Naturalness (2007.14396)</a> paper discussed above. Spontaneously broken conformal sectors also provide a concrete way to realize the continuum states which we studied in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16326">The Continuum Dark Matter Zoo (2210.16326)</a>.</p>
                <p>These models generally feature a new particle called a dilaton, which is the Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken scale invariance. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15324">a-Anomalous Interactions of the Holographic Dilaton (2205.15324)</a>, we explored the low-energy effective action for the dilaton. There's a particular term in the action whose coefficient is fixed by an anomaly in the CFT. This can have important consequences for phenomenology and cosmology!</p>

                <h2>extended Higgs sectors</h2>
                <p>Starting the summer after undergrad and continuing into grad school, I worked on the Georgi-Machacek model. In this model, the Standard Model Higgs sector is extended by two SU(2) triplets, in such a way that naturally preserves the rho-parameter (the W to Z boson mass ratio; equivalently, the electroweak T parameter) at tree level. Another interesting feature in this model is the existence of doubly charged Higgs bosons. More generally, it serves as a nice prototype for extensions of the Higgs sector containing SU(2) representation larger than doublets.</p>
                <p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02272">Updated constraints on the Georgi-Machacek model from LHC Run 2 (2003.02272)</a>, we did an extensive analysis of the experimental constraints on this model from direct searches for new Higgs bosons, as well as from measurements of the observed 125 GeV Higgs. Some of the code I wrote was later integrated into the next release of the Georgi-Machacek model calculator, <a href="https://people.physics.carleton.ca/~logan/gmcalc/">GMCALC</a>. We also introduced a new benchmark for studying a particular region of the model's parameter space, the so-called "low-m<sub>5</sub>" region, in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05536">Benchmark for LHC searches for low-mass custodial fiveplet scalars in the Georgi-Machacek model (2003.05536)</a>.
                <p>An extended Higgs sector, specifically a two Higgs doublet model, is also a key part of the solution to the hierarchy problem we presented in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02456">Higgs Squared (2210.02456)</a>. In that model, our cosmological selection of a small Higgs mass can naturally push the two Higgs doublet model towards a regime where the additional CP-even Higgs is very light and weakly coupled to the Standard Model. (In two Higgs doublet jargon, the model is naturally in the so-called alignment limit. This is interesting in part because being near the alignment limit is required for consistency with experiment, and our model achieves it without any fine-tuning.)</p>
