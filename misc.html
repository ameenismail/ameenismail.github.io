            <p>Here's some things I've done that have nothing to do with physics.</p>

                <h2>trivia trainer</h2>
                <p>I really like the game show Jeopardy!, and I am a big fan of <a href="http://www.trivia-trainer.com/">Trivia Trainer</a>, which allows you to go through old Jeopardy! questions by category. The website has no built-in support for keyboard shortcuts, so I wrote a userscript for this purpose. <a href="https://github.com/ameenismail/trivia-trainer-keyboard-shortcuts"><b>Here's the code on my GitHub</b></a>.</p>

                <p>As I've written it you can show or hide the answer with the up arrow or the T key, and use the other arrow keys to click the "correct", "incorrect", and "don't know" buttons. But it's easy to customize it to use whatever keys you like.</p>

                <p>Also, if you're unfamiliar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript">userscripts</a>, they are bits of code that modify a webpage. You'll need to install a browser extension such as Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey; then create a new userscript, copy and paste the code I linked above, and save it.</p>

            <section id="ear">
                <h2>ear training</h2>
                <p>I wrote a short Python script to help me with my ear training. <a href="https://github.com/ameenismail/simple-ear-training"><b>Here's the code on my GitHub</b></a>. Basically, it plays you some intervals and you try to guess what the intervals are.</p>

                <p>I think it's pretty easy to use it by running it from the command line. You can easily customize it to use whatever intervals you like.</p>

            <section id="recipes">
                <h2>recipes</h2>
                <p>Here are a couple of recipes I like.</p>

                <h4>chocolate cookies</h4>
                <p>Wet ingredients:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 egg</li>
                    <li>1/3 cup canola oil</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
                    <li>1 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Dry ingredients:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1/3&ndash;1/2 cup cocoa powder</li>
                    <li>2/3 cup flour</li>
                    <li>1/4 tsp. baking powder</li>
                    <li>1/4 tsp. salt</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Bake at 350 Fahrenheit for around 10&ndash;12 minutes. If you put a lot of cocoa powder in you might need to add a tablespoon or two of oil or water to form a proper cookie dough.</p>

                <h4>brownies</h4>
                Ingredients:
                <ul>
                    <li>1/2&ndash;3/4 cup canola oil</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup cocoa powder</li>
                    <li>3 eggs</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup flour</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Heat the oil in the microwave for around 20 seconds, until it's warm. Then mix in the sugar and cocoa, and microwave it again for another 15&ndash;20 seconds. (This heating really makes a difference! I think it's because it helps the sugar dissolve better.) Mix very well. Add the eggs and mix them in, then gently fold in the flour.</p>
               
               <p>You can optionally add vanilla extract and salt, as well as mix-ins like chocolate chips or nuts. Some people say chocolate tastes flat and boring without any salt. I think those people just don't like chocolate enough.</p>

               <p>Anyway, scrape the batter into a pan (I use a 9 inch by 13 inch glass pan, but a smaller pan would probably be fine too). Bake at 350 Fahrenheit for about 20 minutes, maybe a little less if you like your brownies underdone in the centre.</p>
