            <p>Here's some things I've done that have nothing to do with physics.</p>
                <h2>j-play</h2>
		<p>I really like the game show Jeopardy!, and I am a big fan of the <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/j-play/cgaeacdlahcfkbhcabkgpahkccbfppbm?hl=en">j-play Chrome extension</a>, which allows you to play Jeopardy! games off of the <a href="https://www.j-archive.com/">j-archive</a>. I was disappointed that the extension was only available on Chrome, so I ported it to Firefox. <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/j-play/"><b>Here's the listing for the Firefox extension</b></a>, and <a href="https://github.com/ameenismail/j-play-ff"><b>here's the code on my GitHub</b></a>.</p>
                <h2>trivia trainer</h2>
                <p>I also like <a href="http://www.trivia-trainer.com/">Trivia Trainer</a>, which allows you to go through old Jeopardy! questions by category. The website has no built-in support for keyboard shortcuts, so I wrote a userscript for this purpose. <a href="https://github.com/ameenismail/trivia-trainer-keyboard-shortcuts"><b>Here's the code on my GitHub</b></a>.</p>

                <p>As I've written it you can show or hide the answer with the up arrow or the T key, and use the other arrow keys to click the "correct", "incorrect", and "don't know" buttons. But it's easy to customize it to use whatever keys you like.</p>

                <p>Also, if you're unfamiliar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript">userscripts</a>, they are bits of code that modify a webpage. You'll need to install a browser extension such as Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey; then create a new userscript, copy and paste the code I linked above, and save it.</p>
                <h2>ear training</h2>
                <p>I wrote a short Python script to help me with my ear training. <a href="https://github.com/ameenismail/simple-ear-training"><b>Here's the code on my GitHub</b></a>. Basically, it plays you some intervals and you try to guess what the intervals are.</p>

                <p>I think it's pretty easy to use it by running it from the command line. You can easily customize it to use whatever intervals you like.</p>
